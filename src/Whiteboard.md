need to isolate the first vowel in each word = [a,e,i,o,u and sometimes y]
if the first letter is a vowel then print (way) at the end of the word 
if the frist letter is not a vowel two thing must happen:
        one: find the vowel 
        Two: move anything before the vowel to the end of the word and add ay
if the letter y is the frist letter then we consider it a consonant if not it's a vowel
if the word starts with QU then move it to the end cuse there considered a pair
